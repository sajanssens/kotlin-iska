    Kotlin Coroutines are like lightweight threads.
         - They are lightweight because creating coroutines doesn’t allocate new threads.
         - Instead, they use predefined thread (pools) and smart scheduling.

    Additionally, coroutines can be suspended and resumed mid-execution.

    Also, you can easily change the context of the coroutine.
     - What that means is that if we think about threads as construction sites
       and coroutines as workers on the construction site, changing context means
       shifting a worker from one site to an another.

    Coroutines are very similar to threads.

    However, coroutines are cooperatively multitasked,
    whereas threads are typically preemptively multitasked.

    This means that coroutines provide concurrency but not parallelism.

/*
    Drawbacks Threads:
        - Expensive.
             require context switches which are costly.
        - Not infinite.
             The number of threads that can be launched is limited by the underlying operating system.
             In server-side applications, this could cause a major bottleneck.
        - Not always available.
             Some platforms, such as JavaScript do not even support threads
        - Not easy.
             Debugging threads, avoiding race conditions are common problems we suffer in multi-threaded programming.

    Other async mechanisms and their properties:

    * Callbacks
        - Difficulty of nested callbacks
        - Error handling is complicated
    * Futures, promises, and others
        - Different programming model
        - Different APIs
        - Specific return type
        - Error handling can be complicated
    * Reactive extensions (Rx)
        - Different programming model
            - Observer pattern
            - Streams
        - Consistent API experience
        - Nicer approach to error handling

// Now, suppose we want to fetch a lot of data from github (repos and all contributors within those)
// and display this data within a UI without blocking it, what are the options? See resources/../comparison.

// That being said, let's test how light coroutines are vs threads:

fun testHowLightCoroutinesAre() {
    val c = measure(10_000, ::coroutine)
    val t = measure(10_000, ::thread)
    println("These threads are ${(t / c).round(2)} times slower than coroutines.")
}

private fun coroutine() {
    GlobalScope.launch { /*noop*/ }
}

private fun thread() {
    thread { /*noop*/ }
}

fun main() {
    testHowLightCoroutinesAre()
}
